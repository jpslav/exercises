# Routine for searching for users
#
# Caller provides a query and some options.  The query follows the rules of
# https://github.com/bruce/keyword_search, e.g.:
#
#   "username:jps,richb" --> returns the "jps" and "richb" users
#   "name:John" --> returns Users with first, last, or full name starting with "John"
#
# Query terms can be combined, e.g. "username:jp first_name:john"
#
# There are currently two options to control query pagination:
#
#   :per_page -- the max number of results to return (default: 20)
#   :page     -- the zero-indexed page to return (default: 0)

  # TODO increase the security of this search algorithm:
  #
  #   For certain users we might want to restrict the fields that can be searched
  #   as well as the fields that are returned.  For example, we probably don't want
  #   to return email address information to an OpenStax SPA in a client's browser,
  #   but we'd be ok returning email addresses directly to an OpenStax server.
  #
  #   I favor an approach where no permissions are granted by default -- where the
  #   requesting code has to explicitly say that the search routine can search by
  #   such and such fields and return such and such other fields.  That way it protects
  #   us from accidentally using more fields than we should.
  #
  #   For restriction what fields we return we can use a "select" clause on our query.
  #   This works for fields in User, but what about restricting access to associated
  #   ContactInfos?  Ideally we'd be able to prevent other code from being able to send
  #   this info back to the requestor.  Maybe this logic has to go outside of this class
  #   (like in the API representer or view code).
  #
  #   We should prohibit Users from searching by username or name if they don't provide
  #   enough characters (so as to discourage them from querying all Users or from
  #   querying all Users whose username starts with 'a', then 'b', then 'c' and so on).
  #   What to do if a first name is "V" or "JP" -- hard to make this restriction here.
  #   Another option might be to limit the number of results for less priviledged
  #   requestors so they can't query the whole User table.
  #
  #   Maybe we also want to have a default per_page value?  Also, different allowed
  #   max per_page values for different levels of user (e.g. applications can do whatever,
  #   non-admin Users can only get 20 at a time, etc.)
